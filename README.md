## Scala Collections

Use `+(k->v)` to add elements to a Map

## Scala Functions and Methods

Syntax for a lambda 
```scala
val lambda = (x:Int)=>expression
```
Note: the bracketes around `x:Int` are probably necessary

Suppose you have defined a funktion
```scala
def f(x:Type):ResultType = expression
```
then the literal `f` cannot be used as a value (because the compiler would like to apply this to some argument),
use Eta-expansion in this situation
```scala
val fAsLambda = f _
```
The underscore transforms the function to a lambda value.

## Scala implicits
If one declares a variable 
```scala
implicit val foo = 3
```
it will be sucked into implicit parameters of functions.
