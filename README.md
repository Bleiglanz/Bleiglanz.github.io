###Knowledge base

## Scala Collections

Use `+(k->v)` to add elements to a Map

## Scala Functions and Methods

Syntax for a lambda 
```scala
val lambda = (x:Int)=>expression
```
Note: the bracketes around `x:Int` are probably necessary

Suppose you have defined a funktion
```scala
def f(x:Type):ResultType = expression
```
then the literal `f` cannot be used as a value (because the compiler would like to apply this to some argument),
use Eta-expansion in this situation
```scala
val fAsLambda = f _
```
The underscore transforms the function to a lambda value.

## Scala implicits
If one declares a variable 
```scala
implicit val foo = 3
```
it will be sucked into implicit parameters of functions.

## Scala Traversable
Important methods
```scala
++  // left followed by right, left determines type of result
++: // left followed by right, right determans type of result
/:  // fold left
:\  // fold right
addString     // add everything to StringBuilder
aggregate     // aggregate using to operators (B,A)=>B (like map) and (B,B)=>B (like fold)
              // more general than fold or reduce
collect       // apply a partial function
collectFirst  // apply a partial function to the first element where it is defined
companion     // factory companion to build Traversable
copyToArray   // copies elements to Array
copyToBuffer  // copies elements to Buffer
count         // number of elements for which predicate is true
drop          // new collection with all but the first n
dropWhile     // drop elements not satisfying a predicate
exists        // does there exist an element satisfying this predicate
filter        // ignore some
filterNot     // invert given predicate
find          // headOption circ filter (find the first)
flatMap       // apply collection producing function and flatten
flatten       // remove package level
fold          // use associative binary operator
foldLeft      // /:
foldRight     // :\
forall        // do all elements satisfy the predicate?
```
## Scala Curry
If you want real currying, then define your function like this
```scala 
def foo(x:Int)(y:Int):ResType = ... 
def hoo = f(3)(_:Int) 
def normalf(a:Int):Res = ...
def normalc = (f_).curried
```
In this case ```scala foo(3)``` evaluates to a function from integers to Restype!
Nice application: Since we can write single arguments with curly braces, a definition like
```scala 
def repeate(x:Int)(x :=> Unit):ResType = ... 
```
gives you a way to create a nice syntax like ```scala repeat(3){block}```


## Scala Implicits
There are implicit functions arguments, there are implicit values (single named in scope)
and there are implicit conversions to allow reciever conversion `3.getFibonacci` is not defined,
but the `3` can be automatically converted to something that understands the method call.

## Scala Lists
A list is a cons cell. First element is a A, second element is a List
`Nil` is the empty list, of type `Nothing`, and `List(1)==1::Nil`

## Scala case classes
Nice: `apply, unapply, copy, equals, hashcode, toString`
Nice: don't have to use `new`
Jargon: Lenses are a pattern for copying in deeply nested structures

## Scala for comprehension
```scala
for(variable <- generator) yield ...       // map
for(variable <- generator) { sideeffect }  // foreach
for(variable <- generator if variable ...) // withFilter
for(a <- g1, b<- g2)...                    // flatMap
```

# Rust

## General stuff

Tools: rustc, rustup, cargo, rustfmt,...

Rust uses snake_case_format

Rust uses 4-space indent

Create a new runable with `cargo new --bin name_of_prj`

Create a new library with `cargo new --lib name_of_lib`

If directory already exists, use `init` instead of `new`

`rustup update; cargo update`, important if nightly is used

`cargo run` builds an runs a binary app

shortcut `cargo b r t`...

Rust uses a simple directory layout (source files are in `src`)

Configuration is in `Cargo.toml`

Command line arguments in `std::env::args`

Results are `OK(value)` or `Err(e)`, just use `unwrap()` to panic if something is wrong

To bring names into scope, use `use`

## Variables

`let variable_name:Type = ...` is the standard way to bind a name to a value

`let mut variable_name:Type = ...` creates something mutable

## Expressions

`while` as usual

`for x in iter` as usual, for arrays create an iterator with `.iter()`

`if cond {} else {}` has no `(...)` for condition, it is an *expression* with a value

`loop` is infinite, has to have a `break`

blocks `{}` are values, the last expression should have no `;`

statements are terminated by `;`, they don't have a value

## Functions

```
fn tolstoi (arg:Type, arg2:Type) -> ResultType {

}
```
typically the last expression isn't followed by an `;`, in this case it is the result.
Think about the last semicolon in the function body!

## Macros

can be recognized by `!` at the end of the name `println!`, `assert!`

## Attributes=Annotations
```
#[test] 
fn test_this(){
    assert_eq!(1,1);
}
```
can be used, in this case a unit test (typically in the same source)
also: annotate the module ```#[cfg(test)]```
j

## Strings

```
    let mut s:String = "Hallo".to_string(); // String literals are refs, have to be converted?
    let p:&str   = "Foo";
```
Hm, String literals are ref by nature!

## Misc

`use` only brings things into scope, does not include anything

`let mut` und `let` assignment, also ownership implied, `const` for constants

`for x in coll` for loop

`std::env::args` is iterator for command line arguments

`unwrap` means just panic if not ok

`expect` also panics, but additional message

`Result` is an enum with `Ok(x)` and `Err(e)` as values

`&name` und `&mut name` just borrows, ownership untouched, deref with `*`

method calls `o.meth()` automatically derefs

raw string with `r#""#`

serialization -> serde

modules: careful `mod name` and `pub mod name`

arrays `[1,2,3,4]` fixed length (at compile time!), fixed types, on the stack

arrays index access `a[i]` is checked at runtime

array init `[0;1000]` semicolon to seperate default value

tuples `[1,"test"]` as usual, index starts with 0

one element tuple with `(1,)` because otherwise evaluation with brackets

every block has a value, if last expr doesn't have a semicolon

`for n in 0..8` has 8 elements, makes easy slicing...

`for x in xyz.iter()` often necessary

use underscore `_` for unused values

`format print write eprint` essentially the same (output varies)

casting is done via `expr as i64` -> From trait

a `?` inside a function body at a `Result<A,B>` return `Err(b)` at failure

closures syntax is `|x|{ body }`, use `move` if capture owership necessary

pattern matching in let statements `let (a,b) = fnreturnstuple();`, also for enums,..

rust allows shadowing, i.e. reassignment -> do this if type changes (unproblematic)

statement `let x=5;` has no value, contrast with expression -> a semicolon means something!

flow `loop{}` and `while cond {}` and `for x in coll {}`

slices have type `let x:&[T]=arr[0..n]`, always refs!

(index,value) pairs can be created with `...iter().enumerate()`

format for debugging with `{:?}`

use the `vec![init;len]` macro to initialize a vector

notice `&str` and `String` have no index acces (unicode), from `String` to `&str` automatically

a `&str` is a `&[u8]`, but contains only valid codepoints

collection `Vec<T>` allows slices, indexed access, etc.

also HashMap, BTreeMap, Set, ...

`coll.iter()` returns an iterator, is lazy (does nothing) - iterator has essentially one method: `next`

standard: `coll.iter().map().filter().collect()` everything is lazy, call collect at last

Rule of borrowing: `&` borrows a Ref, and `*` derefs it

Literal Strings `r##"?"##` is a raw String

rustup update to update toolchain

cargo search to search for packages

`pub mod myname {}` declares a public module

arrays have fixed length, can be initialized with `[27;10000]` (the size is a compile time constant)

tuples have mixed Types `(a,b,c)` has type `(A,B,C)`, access via `tuple.0,...,tuple.k`

if has no brackes around the condition, for loops with `for x in 3..7` or `for x in arr.iter()`

underscore for unused variable `_` or for a throwaway match while pattern matching

`format`, `print` and `write` use the same technology

type conversion allowed via `x as NewType` if possible

only inside a function can we use `stmt?` if the fn returns a Result. Then `Err(e)` is returned!

Lambdas (unnamed functions) via `|arglist|{body}`

the `let` is already pattern matching `let (a,b)=...`
